## Results

Accuracy: 71.5%

Training set size: 500
Hyperparameters:
* Batch size: 128
* Epochs: 10
* Triplet Loss margin: 1
* Learning Rate: 1e-3
* Embedding Dimension: 256

:warning: **Important note** :warning:: I trained the model with my old computer and it crashed when the parameters / training set was too high.
Even if it's a lite training, the results are promising (for a better training ofc)

    -> Special thanks for his job. I tried a lot of different maneer to apply my triplet loss without interesting results during 1 week. And I found this kaggle, very helpful and unlock me. Thanks again <3
